# First Shoshin Technical Exam

_**(NOTE: JAVA DEV EXAM.pdf) Used other HTTP Methods available (GET, DELETE and PUT) and not using POST to all endpoints :)**_

## Getting Started

Run the jar file _**fs-test-1.0.0.jar**_

```Terminal
$ java -jar fs-test-1.0.0.jar
```

Once up and running access the URL http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui.html#/ to see all endpoints defined.

_**NOTE:**_

- Used swagger for api documentation
- Environment has Postgresql up and running (_**Required**_)
